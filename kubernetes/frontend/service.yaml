# WHAT: NodePort Service that exposes the frontend outside the cluster
# WHY:  unlike ClusterIP, NodePort makes the service reachable from
#       the host machine via `minikube service frontend -n crea3d`
# ANALOGY: like opening a public-facing port on a firewall —
#          in production this would be replaced by an Ingress controller
